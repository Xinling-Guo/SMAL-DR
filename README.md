# SMAL-DR: Structural fold mining-and deep learning-guided domain recombination

This repository contains the code for a comprehensive pipeline designed to process protein domain data using various tasks. The pipeline integrates sequence analysis, domain boundary detection, and deep learning models (MLP and Transformer) for protein data classification, training, and inference.

The tasks in this pipeline are:
- **Task 1**: Protein sequence data processing and domain identification.
- **Task 2**: Domain boundary refinement using DALI structural alignment.
- **Task 3**: MLP-based model training for protein data.
- **Task 4**: MLP-based model inference for protein data.
- **Task 5**: Transformer-based model training for protein data.
- **Task 6**: Transformer-based model inference for protein data.

## Requirements

This pipeline requires Python 3.9 and several external libraries. To install all the required dependencies, you can use the provided `requirements.txt` file.

### Install Dependencies
